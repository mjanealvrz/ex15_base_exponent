#  Write a function called exponent(base, exp) that returns an int value of base raises to the power of exp.
# Note here exp is a non-negative integer, and the base is an integer.

# Pseudocode
# Set variable for base and exponent and store values
# Create a function to calculate the exponentiation
    # Calculate the result of base raised to the power of exp
    # Return the calculated result
# Print result
